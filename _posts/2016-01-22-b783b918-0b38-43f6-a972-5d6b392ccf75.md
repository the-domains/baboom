Bitcoin\[note 5\]\[note 6\] is a digital asset\[16\] and a payment system invented by Satoshi Nakamoto,\[note 7\] who published the invention in 2008\[12\] and released it as open-source software in 2009.\[18\] The system is peer-to-peer; users can transact directly without an intermediary.\[19\]:4 Transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the block chain.\[20\] ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f52b4afc-6ee4-47d7-b2be-9769b8c46a5f.jpg)

The ledger uses bitcoin as its unit of account. The system works without a central repository or single administrator, which has led the U.S. Treasury to categorize bitcoin as a decentralized virtual currency.\[1\] Bitcoin is often called the first cryptocurrency,\[21\]\[22\]\[23\] although prior systems existed.\[note 8\] Bitcoin is more correctly described as the first decentralized digital currency.\[19\]\[26\] It is the largest of its kind in terms of total market value.\[27\]
Bitcoins are created as a reward for payment processing work in which users offer their computing power to verify and record payments into a public ledger. This activity is called mining and miners are rewarded with transaction fees and newly created bitcoins.\[19\] Besides being obtained by mining, bitcoins can be exchanged for other currencies,\[28\] products, and services.\[29\] Users can send and receive bitcoins for an optional transaction fee.\[30\]
Bitcoin as a form of payment for products and services has grown,\[29\] and merchants have had an incentive to accept it because fees were generally\[31\] lower than the 2--3% typically imposed by credit card processors.\[32\] Unlike credit cards, any fees are paid by the purchaser, not the vendor. The European Banking Authority\[33\] and other sources\[19\]:11 have warned that bitcoin users are not protected by refund rights or chargebacks. Despite a large increase in the number of merchants accepting bitcoin, the cryptocurrency does not have much momentum in retail transactions.\[34\]
The use of bitcoin by criminals has attracted the attention of financial regulators,\[35\] legislative bodies,\[36\] law enforcement,\[37\] and media.\[38\] Criminal activities are primarily centered around black markets and theft, though officials in countries such as the United States also recognize that bitcoin can provide legitimate financial services.\[39\]
Bitcoin has drawn the support of a few politicians, notably U.S. Presidential candidate Rand Paul, who accepts donations in bitcoin.\[40\]
